  <h2>About MotoCoach</h2>
  <p>
    MotoCoach is a mobile app that provides AI-assisted coaching for closed-circuit
    motorcycle track days. The app is distributed via the Apple App Store.
  </p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App usage data:</strong> basic anonymous statistics provided by Apple (for example installs, crashes).</li>
    <li><strong>In-app information:</strong> rider name, bike names, notes and session details that you type into the app. This data is stored locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not create our own user accounts in MotoCoach and we do not require you
    to sign in with an email address or password.
  </p>

  <h2>Subscriptions & payments</h2>

    Payments and subscriptions are handled by Apple via your Apple ID.
    We do not have access to your full payment details.

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>

    MotoCoach uses OpenAI’s API to generate coaching suggestions from the text you enter.
