    <div class="breadcrumbs">
      <a href="index.html">MotoCoach Dashboard</a> · FAQ
    </div>

    <p class="tagline">
      MotoCoach is designed for track days and practice sessions. Below are answers to common questions about
      bikes, cars, karts, iPhone mounting, subscriptions, and safety.
    </p>

    <!-- GENERAL -->
    <h2>General</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is MotoCoach?</summary>
      <p>
        MotoCoach is an AI-powered coaching app for closed-circuit track use. It combines a lap timer, optional
        video + GPS recording, and AI coaching tools to help you improve setup, consistency, and confidence on track.
        It does not control your vehicle in any way.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Who is MotoCoach for?</summary>
      <p>
        MotoCoach is built for track day riders and drivers – from beginners up to experienced club racers.
        It works with motorcycles, cars, and karts as long as you are using it on a closed circuit or test day.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do I need an account or login?</summary>
      <p>
        No. MotoCoach does not use its own account system. Your bike names, notes, and session details are stored
        locally on your device. Subscription and payments are handled by Apple via your Apple ID.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- iPHONE & MOUNTING -->
    <h2>iPhone & Mounting</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Can vibration from my bike damage the iPhone?</summary>
      <p>
        Strong, long-term vibration can affect optical image stabilisation and camera performance on some iPhone models.
        If you mount the phone on a motorcycle, we strongly recommend a quality mount with a vibration-dampening module,
        and mounting it to the chassis or yoke rather than directly to the handlebar where possible.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I use MotoCoach while racing?</summary>
      <p>
        MotoCoach is designed for track days, testing, and training – not as an official race timing or control system.
        Always follow the rules of your circuit or race organiser regarding phone use and camera mounting.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does MotoCoach need mobile signal?</summary>
      <p>
        No. Lap timing and GPS recording work offline once a session has started. You only need a connection
        for AI coaching requests (sending text to the AI) and for backing up or updating the app.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- MOTORBIKES -->
    <h2>Motorbikes</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Is MotoCoach safe to use on a motorcycle track day?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes – provided that the phone is securely mounted, not obstructing your view, and you do not interact with it
        while riding. Start your session in the paddock, set the phone, and then ride normally. Treat MotoCoach as a
        tool for feedback between sessions, not something to watch mid-corner.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can MotoCoach replace a riding coach?</summary>
      <p>
        MotoCoach cannot replace real-world instruction from an experienced coach or instructor. It is designed to
        support your learning with structured questions, setup guidance, and data from your own laps.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- CARS & KARTS -->
    <h2>Cars & Karts</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I use MotoCoach in a car?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. The lap timer and video + GPS tools can be used in cars on track days and test sessions. Mount the phone
        securely inside the cabin, away from airbags and controls, and follow all circuit rules.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I use MotoCoach for karting?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. MotoCoach can be used for kart track days and practice sessions. As with bikes and cars, make sure the
        phone is mounted securely and protected from vibration and weather. Young drivers should be supervised by an adult.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is MotoCoach an official timing system?</summary>
      <p>
        No. MotoCoach is for personal training use only. It is not certified for official race timing or adjudication.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- SUBSCRIPTION & BILLING -->
    <h2>Subscription & Billing</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What features are free?</summary>
      <p>
        The Lap Timer and Settings/Bikes screens are free to use. You can time sessions, save laps, and manage your bikes
        without a subscription.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What features require a subscription?</summary>
      <p>
        The AI-powered tools require a subscription. This includes Today at the Track, tyre pressure suggestions,
        suspension setup guidance, track conditions & grip, gearing help, braking stability, body position coaching,
        confidence & mindset, and the general troubleshooting chat.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How is the subscription billed?</summary>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID as an auto-renewing monthly plan with a 7-day free trial
        for new subscribers. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your Apple ID
        <em>Subscriptions</em> settings. MotoCoach never sees your card details.
      </p>
    </details>

    <!-- SAFETY & LIMITATIONS -->
    <h2>Safety & Limitations</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Does MotoCoach control my bike, car, or kart?</summary>
      <p>
        No. MotoCoach only records data and provides written coaching suggestions. It does not control or change
        any part of your vehicle, and it cannot override your judgement. You are always responsible for how you ride or drive.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can MotoCoach guarantee lap time improvements?</summary>
      <p>
        No. MotoCoach provides structured advice and suggestions based on your inputs, but actual lap times depend on
        many factors including track conditions, tyres, bike/car setup, weather, and your own riding or driving.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Who is responsible if I crash or damage equipment?</summary>
      <p>
        You are responsible for your own riding or driving and for any equipment you use. MotoCoach is a
        coaching and training tool only. Always ride within your limits and follow the rules of the track.
      </p>
