  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 22 November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    MotoCoach is an educational tool that provides coaching suggestions for
    closed-circuit motorcycle track days. It does not replace professional
    instruction or your own judgement as a rider.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Safety</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for riding within your own limits and obeying all rules of the track.</li>
    <li>Advice in the app is general guidance only and may not be suitable for every rider or situation.</li>
    <li>MotoCoach is not intended for use on public roads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Access to premium features is provided through an auto-renewing subscription
    managed by Apple via your Apple ID. You can cancel or change your
    subscription at any time in your Apple ID settings.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No guarantee of performance</h2>
  <p>
    We do not guarantee any specific improvement in lap times, riding skill, or
    performance. Use the app as one of many tools in your learning.
  </p>
